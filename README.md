# Line-Following-Bot
A smart autonomous robot that follows a path using infrared sensors and PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control for accurate and stable line tracking. Built using Arduino and an L2983D motor driver shield, this project demonstrates key concepts in robotics such as sensor calibration, real-time control systems, and motor actuation.
